# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis is to determine the best suited machine learning model to assess credit risk. By this, we evaluated different machine learning models by having them repeat the same process. The outcomes will help us decide which is the best model.

Results: 

Balanced Accuracy Scores of Each Machine Learning Model

- Naive Random Sampling: 0.67
- SMOTE Oversampling: 0.68
- Undersampling: 0.59
- Combination Sampling: 0.68
- Balanced Random Forest Classifier: 0.79
- Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier: 0.93

Summary: 
Based on their balanced accuracy scores, Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classier definitely stood out compared to the other models. Since this is dealing with risk, the higher the accuracy, the better the model. If LendingClub has to pick from this list, Easy Ensemble AdaBoost is the best choice.
